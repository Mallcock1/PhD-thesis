Over 50 years of solar magnetohydrodynamic wave theory has focussed on waveguides in symmetric plasma environments. Yet the Sunâ€™s inhomogeneous atmosphere supports waveguides held in asymmetric equilibrium. In this thesis, we break this symmetry by studying a slab waveguide model embedded in an asymmetric external plasma with three approaches:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Eigenvalue problem: We derive the dispersion relation and show that asymmetric eigenmodes have mixed properties of the traditional sausage and kink modes.
	\item Ray theory: We demonstrate how a ray theoretic approach can be used to derive this dispersion relation, giving an intuitive description of asymmetric leaky modes.
	\item Initial value problem: An initial perturbation of an asymmetric slab evolves, in general, through a series of three phases: the \textit{initial phase}, the period before collective modes are excited; the \textit{impulsive phase}, where leaky modes can dominate; and the \textit{stationary phase}, where trapped modes dominate for an indefinite time period. We show that, in general, the impulsive phase for a slab is significantly shorter than for a magnetic flux tube. We then show that an asymmetric slab of cold plasma does not have a stationary phase because the principle kink mode in an asymmetric slab is leaky.
\end{itemize}
Next, we derive two magneto-seismology techniques to estimate the magnetic field strength in asymmetric solar waveguides. We apply this novel technique to a series of solar chromospheric fibrils as a proof of concept with estimated values of the Alfv\'{e}n speed that agree with estimates using traditional techniques.
