Over 50 years of solar magnetohydrodynamic wave theory has focussed on waveguides in symmetric plasma environments. Yet the Sunâ€™s inhomogeneous atmosphere allows for waveguides to be held in asymmetric equilibrium. We break symmetry by studying a slab waveguide model embedded in an asymmetric external plasma with three approaches:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Eigenvalue problem: We derive the dispersion relation and show that asymmetric eigenmodes have mixed properties of the traditional sausage and kink modes.
	\item Ray theory: We demonstrate how a ray theoretic approach can be used to derive this dispersion relation, giving an intuitive description of asymmetric leaky modes.
	\item Initial value problem: An initial perturbation of an asymmetric slab evolves, in general, through a series of three phases: the \textit{initial phase}, the period before collective modes are excited; the \textit{impulsive phase}, where leaky modes can dominate; and the \textit{stationary phase}, where trapped modes dominate for an indefinite time period. We show that, in general, the impulsive phase for a slab is significantly shorter than for a magnetic flux tube. We then show that an asymmetric slab of cold plasma does not have a stationary phase because the principle kink mode becomes leaky.
\end{itemize}
Next, we embark on deriving a magneto-seismology technique to estimate the magnetic field strength in waveguides embedded in asymmetric external plasmas. We apply this novel technique to a series of solar chromospheric fibrils as a proof of concept with estimated values of the Alfv\'{e}n speed that are in the ball-park of previous estimates.
