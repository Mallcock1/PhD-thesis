I am grateful for the financial support of the University Prize Scholarship from the University of Sheffield. Thank you to my academic supervisor for support throughout my undergraduate and postgraduate journey.

Thank you to everyone who has contributed to my office being a pleasant place to spend many hours a day for the last four years. Thank you and good luck to those who are still on their PhD journey: Anwar, Farhad, Fionnlagh, Noemi, and Vinh. Thank you to those who have already moved on: Alex, Chris, Ellie, Freddie, Marianna, Mihai, Norbert, Rachael, Rahul, Stuart, and Tamas. Thank you to those in the rest of the School of Mathematics and Statistics who have been no less important: Callum, Drew, Fay, Hope, and Poppy.

Thank you to my family who have had a major role in getting me to this point. In particular, thank you to Becky, who has been by my side throughout. Finally, thank you to my Sheffield household who have felt like a family and treated me as such: Miriam, Ellie, and Fay.
