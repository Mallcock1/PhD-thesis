Thank you to my academic supervisor Robertus von F\'{a}y Siebenb\"{u}rgen for support throughout my undergraduate and postgraduate journey at the University of Sheffield. I am grateful for the financial support of the University Prize Scholarship from the University of Sheffield, one of the key factors in my choice to remain at the university for my PhD.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to my office being a pleasant place to spend many hours a day for the last 4 year. Thank you and good luck to those who are still on their journey: Anwar, Farhad, Fionnlagh, Noemi, and Vinh. And those who have already moved on: Alex, Chris, Ellie, Freddie, Marianna, Mihai, Norby, Rachael, Rahul, Stuart, and Tamas. And those in the rest of the School of Mathematics and Statistics who have been no less important: Callum, Drew, Fay, Hope, and Poppy.

Thank you to my family who have had a major role in getting me to this point. In particular, thank you to Rebecca, who has been by my side throughout. And to my Sheffield household who have felt like a family and treated me like such: Miriam, Ellie, and Fay.
