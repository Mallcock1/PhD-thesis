\chapter{Eigenmodes of an asymmetric spring-mass oscillator} \label{app: coupled oscillator modes}
In this appendix, we prove that the breathing mode has its highest amplitude on the mass connected to the external spring with lowest spring constant and the sloshing mode has highest amplitude on the mass connected to the external spring with highest spring constant.

Without loss of generality, let $\omega_2 > \omega_1$, so that the spring on the right has higher spring constant than the spring on the left. First, consider the case when $W < 1$. For the breathing mode, which has eigenfrequency $\omega_+$,
\begin{align}
	\left| \frac{\hat{x}_1}{\hat{x}_2} \right| & = \frac{1}{2W} \left(1 + \sqrt{1 + 4W^2}\right) \\
	& >  \frac{1}{2} \left(1 + \sqrt{1}\right), \quad \text{since $0 < W < 1$,} \\
	& = 1.
\end{align}
Therefore, the oscillation amplitude of the mass on the left is higher. For the sloshing mode, which has eigenfrequency $\omega_-$,
\begin{align}
	\left| \frac{\hat{x}_1}{\hat{x}_2} \right| & = \frac{1}{2W} \left|1 - \sqrt{1 + 4W^2}\right| \\
	& = \frac{1}{2W} \left(\sqrt{1 + 4W^2} - 1\right) \\
	& \leq \frac{1}{2W} \left(\sqrt{1} + \sqrt{4W^2} - 1\right), \quad \text{by the triangle inequality,} \\
	& = 1.
\end{align}
Therefore, the oscillation amplitude of the mass on the right is higher.

Next, consider the case when $W > 1$. For the breathing mode,
\begin{align}
\left| \frac{\hat{x}_1}{\hat{x}_2} \right| & = \frac{1}{2W} \left(1 + \sqrt{1 + 4W^2}\right) \\
& \geq \frac{1}{2W} \sqrt{2 + 4W^2}, \quad \text{by the triangle inequality,} \\
& = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2W} + 1} \\
& > 1,  \quad \text{since $W > 0$.}
\end{align}
Therefore, the oscillation amplitude of the mass on the left is higher. For the sloshing mode,
\begin{align}
\left| \frac{\hat{x}_1}{\hat{x}_2} \right| & = \frac{1}{2W} \left(\sqrt{1 + 4W^2} - 1\right) \\
& \leq \frac{1}{2W} \left(\sqrt{1 + 4W^2 - 1}\right), \quad \text{by the reverse triangle inequality,} \\
& = 1.
\end{align}
Therefore, the oscillation amplitude of the mass on the right is higher.

Finally, it is trivial to show the same result holds in the case where $W = 1$. This completes the proof that the breathing mode has highest amplitude on the mass connected to the external spring with lowest spring constant and the sloshing mode has highest amplitude on the mass connected to the external spring with highest spring constant.
