\chapter{Asymmetric waveguides - eigenvalue problem}
\label{chap: EVP}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The simplest model of an asymmetric waveguide is an asymmetric magnetic slab in a non-magnetic environment\footnote{More precisely, the simplest model of an asymmetric MHD waveguide is an interface between different plasmas; the asymmetric slab is the simplest asymmetric waveguide that can oscillate in a collective body mode (see Section~\ref{sec: body}).}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Chapter introduction}
\label{sec: EVP intro}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section~\ref{sec: EVP non-mag} is based on \cite{all_etal17} and Section~\ref{sec: EVP mag} is based on \cite{zsa_etal18}.

\subsection{Model description}
Figure~\ref{fig:eq} illustrates the construction of this mathematical model, where a three-dimensional, unbounded, inviscid plasma is separated into three regions by two parallel planar interfaces at $x = \pm x_0$. The equilibrium magnetic field is in the $z$-direction and has magnitude
\begin{equation}
	B(x)=
	\begin{cases}
		B_1 & \text{if } x < -x_0, \\
		B_0 & \text{if } |x|\leq{x_0}, \\
		B_2 & \text{if } x > x_0,
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $B_j$, for $j = 0, 1, 2$ are constant. Within each region, denoted by subscripts 0, 1, and 2, the plasma is uniform and the equilibrium plasma pressure, density, and temperature are denoted by $p_j$, $\rho_j$, and $T_j$, respectively, for $j = 0, 1, 2$. This defines an \textit{isolated} waveguide, by which we mean there is no adjacent waveguides that can effect the oscillations.

To ensure that the model is in equilibrium, the total pressure in each external region must balance the total pressure in the internal region, namely
\begin{equation}
	p_1 + \frac{B_1^2}{2\mu_0} = p_0 + \frac{B_0^2}{2\mu_0} = p_2 + \frac{B_2^2}{2\mu_0}, \label{pressure balance}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space. We can rewrite Equation~\eqref{pressure balance} as
\begin{equation}
\rho_i\left(c_i^2 + \frac{\gamma}{2}v_{Ai}^2\right) = \rho_j\left(c_j^2 + \frac{\gamma}{2}v_{Aj}^2\right), \quad \text{for} \quad i, j = 0, 1, 2, \label{sound speeds}
\end{equation}
where we define the sound and Alfv\'{e}n speeds in each region by $c_j = \sqrt{\gamma p_j/\rho_j}$ and $v_{Aj} = B_j/\sqrt{\mu\rho_j}$, respectively, for $j = 0, 1, 2$. The adiabatic index\footnote{The adiabatic index is assumed uniform across the whole domain under the single-fluid approximation.} is $\gamma$.


\subsection{The dispersion relation}

In the derivation of the dispersion relation, we decompose the linearised ideal MHD equations into Fourier forms then combine them into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the transverse velocity perturbation for each of the three plasma regions. After finding the general solution to each of these ODEs, we match the solutions across each interface at $\pm x_0$. The condition for the existence of non-trivial solutions will lead to the dispersion relation. In mathematical terms, we're converting a set of partial differential equations into ordinary differential equations into algebraic equations, into a single equation. From a form that we cannot solve into a form that we can.


\subsubsection{Derivation} \label{sec: asym slab DR der}

We begin with the ideal MHD equations, linearised around a static equilibrium with subscripts $j$, Equations~\eqref{cont eqn lin}-\eqref{ind eqn lin}. Taking the partial derivative with respect to time of Equation~\eqref{mom eqn lin} and eliminating $\bB$ using Equation~\eqref{ind eqn lin}, gives \textcolor{red}{Check whether the last - should be a + in the first two eqns below.}
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial^2 v_x}{\partial t^2} &= \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[ (c_j^2 + v_{Aj}^2)\nabla\cdot\bv - v_{Aj}^2\frac{\partial v_z}{\partial z} \right] + v_{Aj}^2 \frac{\partial^2 v_x}{\partial z^2} \label{mom x} \\
	\frac{\partial^2 v_y}{\partial t^2} &= \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left[ (c_j^2 + v_{Aj}^2)\nabla\cdot\bv - v_{Aj}^2\frac{\partial v_z}{\partial z} \right] + v_{Aj}^2 \frac{\partial^2 v_y}{\partial z^2} \label{mom y} \\
	\frac{\partial^2 v_z}{\partial t^2} &= c_j^2\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(\nabla\cdot\bv). \label{mom z}
\end{align}
Taking Fourier solutions like $f(\mathbf{x},t) = \hat{f}(x) \exp{i(ly + kz - \omega t)}$, where $\mathbf{k} = (0, l, k)$ is the wavenumber vector and $\omega$ is the angular frequency, for $\mathbf{v}$ in Equation~\eqref{mom y} gives
\begin{equation}
(k^2v_{Aj}^2 - \omega^2)\hat{v}_y = l((c_j^2 + v_{Aj}^2)(i\hat{v}_x' - l\hat{v}_y - k\hat{v}_z) + kv_{Aj}^2\hat{v}_z),
\end{equation}
where $' = d/dx$. If the component of the wavenumber in the $y$-direction is zero, \textit{i.e.} $l = 0$, then this equation reduces to
\begin{equation}
(k^2v_{Aj}^2 - \omega^2)\hat{v}_y(x) = 0,
\end{equation}
which yield two solutions. Firstly, $\omega^2 = k^2v_{Aj}^2$ is a solution corresponding to shear Alfv\'{e}n waves with different phase speed for each magnetic iso-surface (in this case surfaces parallel to the $yz$-plane). The second solution is $\hat{v}_y(x) = 0$ for all $x$ and therefore $v_y = 0$, \textit{i.e.} waves without perturbation component along the slab and perpendicular to the magnetic field. These solutions correspond to magneto-acoustic modes. Thus we have a decoupling of the shear Alfv\'{e}n modes from the magneto-acoustic modes.

Focusing from here on magneto-acoustic modes, we seek solutions of the Fourier form
\begin{equation}
\bv(\mathbf{x},t)=(\hat{v}_x(x)\textrm{e}^{i(kz-\omega{t})}, 0, \hat{v}_z(x)\textrm{e}^{i(kz-\omega{t})}),
\label{vcomponents}
\end{equation}
This restricts the investigation to magneto-acoustic waves propagating parallel to the equilibrium magnetic field, with velocity perturbation amplitude $\hat{v}_x(x)$ in the $x$-direction, and $\hat{v}_z(x)$ in the $z$-direction. With this ansatz, Equation~\eqref{mom y} degenerates and Equations~\eqref{mom x} and~\eqref{mom z} become
\begin{align}
&-\omega^2\hat{v}_x = (c_j^2+v_\textrm{Aj}^2)(\hat{v}_x'' + ik\hat{v}_z') - v_\textrm{Aj}^2ik\hat{v}_z'-v_\textrm{Aj}^2k^2\hat{v}_x, \label{mom x 2} \\
&-\omega^2\hat{v}_z = c_j^2ik(\hat{v}_x' + ik\hat{v}_z). \label{mom z 2}
\end{align}
These equations can be combined to give an ordinary differential equation for $\hat{v}_x$, namely
\begin{equation}
\hat{v}_x'' - m_j^2\hat{v}_x = 0, \quad \text{where} \quad
m_j^2 = \frac{(k^2v_\textrm{Aj}^2 - \omega^2)(k^2c_j^2 - \omega^2)}{(c_j^2 + v_\textrm{Aj}^2)(k^2c_\textrm{Tj}^2 - \omega^2)}. \label{v_x ODE}
\end{equation}
This is identical to the corresponding equation governing, for example, a tangential interface or a symmetric slab, derived in Sections~\ref{sec: MHD waves interface} and~\ref{sec: MHD waves sym slab} by \cite{rob81a,rob81c}.

Solutions of Equations~\eqref{v_x ODE} are a linear combination of hyperbolic functions. We restrict our model to waves trapped by the slab by imposing the boundary condition $\hat{v}_x \to 0$ as $|x| \to \infty$. Thus, the general solution for the velocity perturbation in the $x$-direction is
\begin{equation}
\hat{v}_x(x)=
\begin{cases}
A(\cosh{m_1x} + \sinh{m_1x}), & \text{if } x < -x_0, \\
B\cosh{m_0x} + C\sinh{m_0x}, & \text{if } |x| \leq {x_0}, \\
D(\cosh{m_2x} - \sinh{m_2x}), & \text{if  } x > x_0, 
\end{cases} \label{vsoln}
\end{equation}
where $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are arbitrary constants (with respect to $x$). The remaining boundary conditions are continuity of velocity and total pressure across the slab boundaries at $x = \pm{x_0}$. With the aim of finding an expression for the total pressure perturbation, the Equations~\eqref{cont eqn lin} and~\eqref{energy eqn lin} can be combined to give
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = - \rho_jc_i^2\nabla\cdot\bv.
\end{equation}
Using the above equation and the $z$-component of Equation~\eqref{ind eqn lin}, the perturbation in total pressure (plasma pressure, $p$, plus magnetic pressure, $B_jB_z/\mu$) across the whole domain can be shown to have amplitude
\begin{equation}
\hat{p}_T(x) = \frac{\Lambda_j}{m_j}\hat{v}_x'(x),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\Lambda_j = \frac{i\rho_j(\omega^2 - \omega_{Aj}^2)}{m_j\omega}, \quad \text{for} \quad j = 0, 1, 2. \label{Lambdas}
\end{equation}
Ensuring continuity of velocity and total pressure across the slab boundaries gives four coupled algebraic equations, namely
\begin{equation}
\left(
\begin{matrix}
c_1-s_1             &-c_0           &s_0            &0                   \\
0                   &c_0            &s_0            &s_2-c_2             \\
\Lambda_1(c_1-s_1)  &\Lambda_0s_0   &-\Lambda_0c_0  &0                   \\
0                   &\Lambda_0s_0   &\Lambda_0c_0   &-\Lambda_2(s_2-c_2)
\end{matrix}
\right)
\left(
\begin{matrix}
A \\
B \\
C \\
D
\end{matrix}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{matrix}
0 \\
0 \\
0 \\
0
\end{matrix}
\right),
\label{coefmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $c_j = \cosh{m_jx_0}$ and $s_j = \sinh{m_jx_0}$ for $j=0,1,2$, for brevity. The condition for the existence of non-trivial solutions to this system of equations is that the determinant of the matrix is zero. Applying this condition gives us the dispersion relation for an asymmetric slab, namely
\begin{equation}
(\Lambda_0^2 + \Lambda_1\Lambda_2) + \Lambda_0(\Lambda_1 + \Lambda_2)\coth{2m_0x_0} = 0. \label{DR lambda}
\end{equation}
By expanding each $\Lambda_j$, we can write this dispersion relation in familiar variables as
\begin{align}
&m_0^2(\omega^2 - \omega_{A1}^2)(\omega^2 - \omega_{A2}^2) + \frac{\rho_0}{\rho_1}m_1\frac{\rho_0}{\rho_2}m_2(\omega^2 - \omega_{A0}^2)^2 \notag \\
& + m_0(\omega^2 - \omega_{A0}^2)\left[\frac{\rho_0}{\rho_1}m_1(\omega^2 - \omega_{A2}^2) + \frac{\rho_0}{\rho_2}m_2(\omega^2 - \omega_{A1}^2)\right]\coth{2m_0x_0} = 0. \label{DR}
\end{align}


\subsubsection{First-order asymmetric slab}

There is a qualitative difference between waves propagating along symmetric and asymmetric magnetic slabs. The dispersion relation governing an asymmetric slab is a single equation, whereas the dispersion relation governing a symmetric slab \citep{rob81a} consists of two independent equations, corresponding to the sausage and kink eigenmodes.

Under the approximation that the densities and temperatures of the external plasma are of the same order, the dispersion relation, Equation~\eqref{DR}, can be factorised to give the approximate dispersion relation
\begin{equation}
\left[\Lambda_0(\Lambda_1+\Lambda_2)+2\Lambda_1\Lambda_2\tanh{m_0x_0}\right]\left[\Lambda_0(\Lambda_1+\Lambda_2)+2\Lambda_1\Lambda_2\coth{m_0x_0}\right]=0. \label{DR approx lambda}
\end{equation}
To show this, define each bracket as the following functions
\begin{align}
D_s(\omega) &:= \Lambda_0(\Lambda_1 + \Lambda_2) + 2\Lambda_1\Lambda_2\tanh{m_0x_0}, \\
D_k(\omega) &:= \Lambda_0 (\Lambda_1 + \Lambda_2) + 2\Lambda_1\Lambda_2\coth{m_0x_0}.
\end{align}
There product is
\begin{align}
D_s(\omega)D_k(\omega) &= \left[ \Lambda_0(\Lambda_1 + \Lambda_2) + 2\Lambda_1\Lambda_2\tanh{m_0x_0} \right] \left[ \Lambda_0 (\Lambda_1 + \Lambda_2) + 2\Lambda_1\Lambda_2\coth{m_0x_0} \right] \\
&= \Lambda_0^2 (\Lambda_1 + \Lambda_2)^2 + 2\Lambda_0(\Lambda_1 + \Lambda_2)\Lambda_1\Lambda_2(\tanh{m_0x_0} + \coth{m_0x_0}) + 4\Lambda_1^2\Lambda_2^2 \\
&= 4\Lambda_1\Lambda_2 \left[ (\Lambda_0^2F + \Lambda_1\Lambda_2) + \Lambda_0(\Lambda_1 + \Lambda_2)\coth(2m_0x_0) \right] \\
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
F = \frac{(\Lambda_1 + \Lambda_2)^2}{4\Lambda_1\Lambda_2}.
\end{equation}
When the plasma parameters on each side of the slab are approximately equal, \textit{i.e.} $\Lambda_2 = \Lambda_1 (1 + \epsilon L)$, with $\epsilon \ll 1$ and $L \approx 1$, $F$ becomes
\begin{equation}
F = \frac{(2 + \epsilon L)^2}{4(1 + \epsilon L)} = 1 + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2).
\end{equation}
Therefore, 
\begin{equation}
(\Lambda_0^2 + \Lambda_1\Lambda_2) + \Lambda_0(\Lambda_1 + \Lambda_2)\coth(2m_0x_0) = \frac{1}{4\Lambda_1\Lambda_2} D_s(\omega) D_k(\omega) + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2).
\end{equation}
Therefore, to linear order of waveguide asymmetry, if the dispersion relation, Equation~\eqref{DR lambda} is satisfied, then either $D_s(\omega) = 0$ or $D_k(\omega) = 0$, which completes the proof of Equation~\eqref{DR approx lambda}.

The expressions for the variables $\Lambda_i$ for $i=0,1,2$ in Equations~\eqref{Lambdas} can be employed to yield the approximately symmetric dispersion relation
\begin{equation}
(\omega^2 - \omega_{A0}^2)\left(\frac{\rho_0}{\rho_1}\frac{m_1}{(\omega^2 - \omega_{A1}^2)} + \frac{\rho_0}{\rho_2}\frac{m_2}{(\omega^2 - \omega_{A2}^2)}\right) + 2m_0\left(\begin{matrix}\tanh \\ \coth \end{matrix}\right)(m_0x_0) = 0. \label{DR approx}
\end{equation}
This equation is now in a form similar to Equation~\eqref{DR sym slab}, the dispersion relation corresponding to MHD waves along a symmetric magnetic slab (Section~\ref{sec: MHD waves sym slab}), namely
\begin{equation}
\rho_im_e(\omega^2 - \omega_\textrm{Ai}^2) + \rho_em_i(\omega^2 - \omega_\textrm{Ae}^2)\left(\begin{matrix}\tanh \\ \coth \end{matrix}\right)(m_ix_0) = 0, \label{DRsym}
\end{equation}
where internal and external parameters are denoted by subscripts $i$ and $e$.


\subsection{Asymmetric eigenmodes}
There is a rich spectrum of MHD eigenmodes on a magnetic slab. In a symmetric slab, the dispersion relation, Equation~\eqref{DRsym}, consists of two decoupled equations that correspond to the two types of eigenmodes supported by the slab: the \textit{sausage} and \textit{kink} MHD waves.

In an asymmetric slab, the sausage and kink modes are modified by the external density difference, causing an asymmetry of the oscillation amplitude on each side of the slab (for visualisation see Figures~\ref{fig:saus} and~\ref{fig:kink}). We call these asymmetric eigenmodes quasi-sausage and quasi-kink modes. In a symmetric slab, sausage modes are characterised by an undisplaced slab axis in the centre of the slab. In an asymmetric slab, this undisplaced position is shifted towards the side of greatest external density for kink modes and towards the side of lowest external density for sausage modes. For symmetric kink modes, the width of the perturbed slab remains constant along the slab, but this characteristic is lost in an asymmetric slab. This highlights the mixed nature of these modes. 

Additionally, this shows that it is the phase of the boundary oscillations that is a more fundamental distinguishing characteristic of sausage and kink modes. For this reason, when we refer to \textit{sausage} and \textit{kink} modes of an asymmetric slab, we refer strictly to modes with boundary oscillations in \textit{anti-phase} and \textit{in-phase}, respectively. The differences between symmetric and asymmetric eigenmodes are summarised in Table~\ref{tab: eigenmode differences}.

Sausage and kink modes are further categorised into \textit{surface} and \textit{body} modes. Surface modes are waves more enhanced at the slab boundaries, whereas body waves are characterised by oscillations permeating spatially throughout the slab, having their maximum amplitude within the slab. Mathematically, surface waves correspond to exponentially damped solutions of Equation~\eqref{vsoln} within the slab. This occurs when $m_0^2 > 0$, which occurs when the phase speed, $\omega/k$, satisfies
\begin{equation}
\frac{\omega}{k}<c_\textrm{T} \quad \text{or} \quad \text{min}\{c_0, v_\textrm{A}\}<\frac{\omega}{k}<\text{max}\{c_0, v_\textrm{A}\}.
\end{equation}
Body waves correspond to trigonometric solutions of Equation~\eqref{vsoln} within the slab. Most notably, this means that there are any number of nodes within the slab where the plasma is unperturbed, so that there exist an infinite set of body eigenmodes. They exist when $m_0^2 < 0$, which occurs when
\begin{equation}
c_\textrm{T}<\frac{\omega}{k}<\text{min}\{c_0, v_\textrm{A}\} \quad \text{or} \quad \text{max}\{c_0, v_\textrm{A}\}<\frac{\omega}{k}. \label{bconditions}
\end{equation}

For a surface mode (Figures~\ref{fig:surf quasi-kink} and~\ref{fig:surf quasi-saus}), the wave power distribution across the slab has a single minimum. The displacement of this minimum from the centre of the slab is a consequence of the asymmetry in the external plasma. The intensity of the maximum amplitudes on the left and right boundaries of the slab is different, reflecting the asymmetry in the external plasma.

Body modes are also affected by the asymmetric external environment (Figures~\ref{fig:body quasi-kink} and~\ref{fig:body quasi-saus}). Local maxima and minima in wave power are shifted towards the external plasma of higher density for a quasi-kink body mode and towards the external plasma of lower density for a quasi-sausage mode. However, this is a much weaker effect than for surface modes because the eigenfrequencies of body waves do not depend strongly on the parameters of the external plasma, and therefore they do not depend strongly on the asymmetry of the waveguide, as shown in Sections~\ref{sec: analytical solutions} and~\ref{sec: numerical solutions}. The same can be said for the eigenfunctions of body modes. These results corroborate the intuition that because the majority of the wave power is confined to within the slab, rather than its boundaries, the body modes don't \textit{feel} the external plasma as much as surface waves do.

\section{Asymmetric slab in a non-magnetic environment}
\label{sec: EVP non-mag}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Much of the interesting physics due to waveguide asymmetry is exhibited by a magnetic slab with non-magnetic external plasma. We study this system in this Section.

By letting $B_1 = B_2 = 0$, the plasma in the asymmetric external regions is non-magnetic. Then the dispersion relation, Equation~\eqref{DR}, simplifies to
\begin{equation}
m_0^2\omega^4 + \frac{\rho_0}{\rho_1}m_1\frac{\rho_0}{\rho_2}m_2(\omega^2 - \omega_\textrm{A0}^2)^2 + m_0(\omega^2 - \omega_{A0}^2)\left(\frac{\rho_0}{\rho_1}m_1 + \frac{\rho_0}{\rho_2}m_2\right)\coth{2m_0x_0} = 0, \label{DR non-mag}
\end{equation}
and the dispersion relation for a slab with first order asymmetry simplifies to
\begin{equation}
(\omega^2 - \omega_\textrm{A0}^2)\left(\frac{\rho_0}{\rho_1}m_1 + \frac{\rho_0}{\rho_2}m_2\right)  +  2\omega^2m_0\left(\begin{matrix}\tanh \\ \coth \end{matrix}\right)(m_0x_0) = 0. \label{DR approx non-mag}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Analytical solutions}
Analytical solutions to the dispersion relation can only be made under further assumptions about the plasma. In this section, incompressible (Section~\ref{sec: incomp}), zero-beta (Section~\ref{sec: zero-beta}), thin slab (Section~\ref{sec: thin slab}), and wide slab (Section~\ref{sec: wide slab}) approximations are explored. First, we deal with spurious solutions in Section~\ref{sec: spurious}.

\subsubsection{Spurious solutions} \label{sec: spurious}
There are three sets of spurious roots to the dispersion relation, $\omega = \pm kv_{A0}$, $\omega = \pm kc_0$, and $\omega = \pm kc_{T0}$. To treat these cases we refer back to the ODE for $\hat{v}_x(x)$ within the slab, Equation~\eqref{v_x ODE}.

When $\omega = \pm kc_{T0}$, $m_0$ is singular, in which case the solution to Equation~\eqref{v_x ODE} is $\hat{v}_x(x) = 0$ within the slab. From Equation\eqref{mom z 2}, it follows that $\hat{v}_z \propto \hat{v}_x'$, we therefore also have $\hat{v}_z(x) = 0$. Given that we are assuming ideal plasma so that the magnetic flux is frozen to the plasma, this means that there is no magnetic field perturbation either. Therefore, $\omega = \pm kc_{T0}$ is a spurious solution.

\textcolor{red}{edit from below here on spurious sols.}

When $\omega = \pm kc_0$, we have $m_0 = 0$, therefore Equation~\eqref{v_x ODE} has general solution $\hat{v}_x(x) = Bx + C$ for constants $B$ and $C$. Equation~\eqref{mom z 2} further shows that  $\hat{v}_x' = 0$. Therefore, $B = 0$ and $\hat{v}_x(x) = C$. The $z$-component of Equation~\eqref{ind eqn lin} tells us that $\hat{b}_z \propto \hat{v}_x'$ and so $\hat{b}_z = 0$, therefore the magnetic pressure perturbation is zero. It can be shown that the plasma pressure is
\begin{equation}
\hat{p}(x) = - \frac{i\rho_0c_0^2}{\omega}\left[\frac{Cx(k^2v_A^2 - \omega^2)}{c_0^2} + C_2\right],
\end{equation}
within the slab, for constant $C_2$. To make pressure balance over each interface we must have $C=0$. This means that $v_x(x)=0$ within the slab and therefore across the whole domain. Therefore the pressure outside the slab is zero (since it is proportional to $\hat{v}_x' = 0$) , and by matching pressure, it is zero within the slab. Therefore this solution is a trivial wave. (is this the entropy wave???)

On the other hand, when $\omega = kv_A$, the total pressure amplitude, $\hat{P}(x)$, is such that
\begin{equation}
\widehat{P}(x)=\widehat{v}_x'(x)
\begin{cases}
\Lambda_1/m_1, & \text{if } x<-x_0, \\
\Lambda_0/m_0, & \text{if }|x|\leq{}x_0, \\
\Lambda_2/m_2, & \text{if }x>x_0,
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\Lambda_0=-\frac{i\rho_0(k^2v_\textrm{A}^2-\omega^2)}{m_0\omega}, \quad \Lambda_1=\frac{i\rho_1\omega}{m_1}, \quad \text{and} \quad \Lambda_2=\frac{i\rho_2\omega}{m_2}. \label{Lambdas}
\end{equation}
(the derivation for this still holds). Note that the singularity due to the division by $m_0^2$ is regulated by the factor of $k^2v_A^2 - \omega^2$ in $\Lambda_0$. Therefore, since $\hat{v}_x' = B$ is constant in the slab, then so is $\hat{P}$. When we match the total pressure over the boundaries we find that the slab must be symmetric. Therefore $B=0$ to ensure that the velocity profile is symmetric. Therefore $\hat{v}_x' = B = 0$, so there is no pressure perturbation. In particular, there is no pressure perturbation outside the slab, which implies that there is no velocity perturbation outside the slab, because they both depend on the same constants. Therefore by continuity of velocity and the fact that it is constant within the slab, the velocity perturbation is zero everywhere. Therefore there is no wave.


\subsubsection{Limiting case - incompressible plasma} \label{sec: incomp}

Compressibility is essential for the propagation of sound waves. Consider the dispersion relation, Equation~\eqref{DR non-mag}, in the limit of incompressibility, that is, when $\gamma \to \infty$. In this limit, the sound speeds become unbounded and the tube speed in the slab behaves like $c_{T0} \to {v_{A0}}$. This means that $m_j \to {k}$ for $j = 0, 1, 2$, so that the dispersion relation reduces to
\begin{equation}
\omega^4 + \frac{\rho_0^2}{\rho_1\rho_2}(\omega^2 - \omega_{A0}^2)^2 + \omega^2(\omega^2 - \omega_{A0}^2)\left(\frac{\rho_0}{\rho_1} + \frac{\rho_0}{\rho_2}\right) \coth{2kx_0} = 0. \label{DR incomp}
\end{equation}
This is a special case of the dispersion relation previously derived by \cite{rud92}, who found solitons propagating on a system of $N$ tangential discontinuities. Equation~\eqref{DR incomp} is a quadratic equation in $\omega^2$ which has solutions
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = k^2v_{A0}^2\left(\frac{2 + \sigma \pm \sqrt{\sigma^2 - 4\frac{\rho_1\rho_2}{\rho_0^2}}}{1 + \sigma + \frac{\rho_1\rho_2}{\rho_0^2}}\right),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \left(\frac{\rho_1}{\rho_0} + \frac{\rho_2}{\rho_0}\right)\coth{2kx_0}.
\end{equation}
These solutions hold for all $kx_0 > 0$ and describe surface modes with sub-Alfv\'enic phase speed. The solution found by the plus (minus) on the numerator is the sausage (kink) eigenfrequency.

Figures~\ref{fig:incomp22}-\ref{fig:incomp10001} demonstrate that in a thin ($kx_0 \ll 1$) incompressible slab, the phase speeds of these modes approach zero or the Alfv\'{e}n speed. In a symmetric wide incompressible slab, the phase speeds converge to the same speed (Figure~\ref{fig:incomp22}), whereas in an asymmetric slab, the phase speeds converge to different speeds (Figures~\ref{fig:incomp102}-\ref{fig:incomp10001}) that depend upon the values of the external densities. This observation is mirrored by both fast and slow surface modes in the more general solutions of a compressible slab solved numerically to give Figure~\ref{fig:slow modes density}.

\subsubsection{Limiting case - low-beta} \label{sec: zero-beta}

The case when the magnetic pressure strongly dominates the gas pressure within the slab, \textit{i.e.} $\beta := 2\mu_0{p_0}/B_0^2 \ll 1$, is known as the \textit{low-beta approximation}. This approximation is equivalent to the Alfv\'{e}n speed dominating the sound speed in the slab and provides a good approximation of the solar coronal environment. In this section, the results are to quadratic order in $\beta$.

Under this speed ordering, $m_0^2\approx{}k^2-\omega^2/v_\textrm{A}^2$. After a numerical investigation, it is clear that the frequency of waves in this approximation satisfies $\omega^2\ll{}k^2v_\textrm{A}^2$, in which case $m_0^2\approx k^2$ provides a valid approximation. This means that $m_0^2>0$ and the solutions are surface modes. For a symmetric slab of low-beta plasma (\textit{e.g.} \citealt{rob81b}), the dispersion relation reduces to a quadratic expression in $\omega^2$ whose solutions are the fast sausage and kink surface modes given by
\begin{equation}
\omega^2=k^2c_\textrm{e}^2\left(\frac{\sqrt{1+\gamma^2\left(\hspace{-0.11in}\begin{matrix}&\tanh^2 \\&\coth^2 \end{matrix}\right)(kx_0)}-1}{\frac{1}{2}\gamma^2\left(\hspace{-0.11in}\begin{matrix}&\tanh^2 \\&\coth^2 \end{matrix}\right)(kx_0)}\right),
\end{equation}
where $c_\textrm{e}$ is the external sound speed, along with a spurious solution.

Unfortunately, for the more general case of an asymmetric slab of low-beta plasma, the dispersion relation does not reduce to an analytically solvable equation. However, we find numerically that there are two fast surface modes. The quasi-sausage surface mode is not present for small $kx_0$, but becomes a solution at an intermediate value of $kx_0$ with phase speed $\omega^2/k^2=\min{(c_1^2,c_2^2)}$. The quasi-kink surface mode is present for all values of $kx_0$. Qualitatively, the solutions for a low-beta plasma are analogous to the fast quasi-sausage and quasi-kink mode solutions, discussed later in Sections~\ref{sec:thin} and~\ref{sec:wide}.

In the following section, thin and wide slab approximations are made to the approximate dispersion relation, Equation~\eqref{DR approx}, rather than the exact dispersion relation, Equation~\eqref{DR}. Here, the aim is to retrieve the variety of wave modes with future applications in mind.


\subsubsection{Limiting case - thin slab} \label{sec: thin slab}

Consider the case where the wavelength, $\lambda$, is much greater than the width of the slab, $2x_0$, \textit{i.e} $2x_0/\lambda = kx_0/\pi \ll 1$, or equivalently $kx_0 \ll 1$.

First, consider the quasi-sausage surface modes, which are governed by the $\tanh$ version of Equation~\eqref{DR approx non-mag}, for $m_0^2 > 0$. In the thin slab limit, this equation reduces to
\begin{equation}
(\omega^2 - \omega_\textrm{A0}^2)\left(\frac{\rho_0}{\rho_1}m_1 + \frac{\rho_0}{\rho_2}m_2\right) -  2\omega^2m_0^2x_0 = 0. \label{thin}
\end{equation}
Clearly, $\omega^2={k^2v_\textrm{A}^2}$ is a solution, but as noted in Section~\ref{sec: spurious}, it is spurious. The other solution for $\omega^2$ behaves like $\omega^2 \to k^2c_\textrm{T0}^2$ as $kx_0 \to 0$. To first order in $kx_0$, this solution is a slow quasi-sausage surface mode given by
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = k^2c_\textrm{T0}^2 \left[1 - \frac{2(kx_0)(c_0^2 - c_\textrm{T0}^2)}{(c_0^2 + v_\textrm{A0}^2)\left(\frac{\rho_0}{\rho_1}\frac{\sqrt{c_1^2 - c_\textrm{T0}^2}}{c_1} + \frac{\rho_0}{\rho_2}\frac{\sqrt{c_2^2 - c_\textrm{T}^2}}{c_2}\right)}\right],
\label{thin slab slow saus surf}
\end{equation}
which is less than $k^2c_\textrm{T0}^2$ and exists only when $c_1 > c_\textrm{T0}$ and $c_2 > c_\textrm{T0}$. 

It is interesting to note that if $c_1 = c_2 = c_\textrm{e}$ (and therefore $\rho_1 = \rho_2 = \rho_\textrm{e}$ by Equation~\eqref{sound and density}), then there exists a second solution to Equation~\eqref{thin}. By letting $\omega^2 = k^2c_\textrm{e}^2(1 + \nu)$ for some $\nu \ll 1$ in Equation~\eqref{thin}, we find the solution to be
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = k^2c_\textrm{e}^2\left(1 - \left[\frac{\rho_\textrm{e}}{\rho_0}\frac{c_\textrm{e}^2(c_0^2 - c_\textrm{e}^2)(kx_0)}{(c_0^2 + v_\textrm{A0}^2)(c_\textrm{T0}^2 - c_\textrm{e}^2)}\right]^2\right)
\label{thin slab fast saus surf}
\end{equation}
in the thin slab limit. This is a fast sausage surface mode, and it degenerates (as a solution in the thin slab limit) as $c_1$ and $c_2$ become distinct. This mode can still exist with a phase speed below the cut-off at $\min(c_1, c_2)$ (see Section~\ref{sec: disp diagrams}).

Next, consider quasi-kink surface mode solutions in the thin slab limit, which are governed by the $\coth$ version of Equation~\eqref{DR approx non-mag}, for $m_0^2 > 0$. As $kx_0 \to 0$, we have $m_0x_0 \to 0$, so $\coth{m_0x_0} \to 1/m_0x_0$. This simplifies the dispersion relation to
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = \frac{k^2x_0v_\textrm{A0}^2\left(\frac{\rho_0}{\rho_1}m_1 + \frac{\rho_0}{\rho_2}m_2\right)}{\left(\frac{\rho_0}{\rho_1}m_1x_0 + \frac{\rho_0}{\rho_2}m_2x_0\right) + 2} \approx \frac{1}{2}k^2v_\textrm{A0}^2\left(\frac{\rho_0}{\rho_1} + \frac{\rho_0}{\rho_2}\right)kx_0.
\label{thin slab slow kink surf}
\end{equation}
This is a slow quasi-kink surface mode that behaves like $\omega/k \to 0$ in the thin slab limit.

For body waves in the thin slab approximation, following the same procedure as for surface waves turns out to be fruitless, so we must reconsider our assumptions. Unfortunately, letting $m_0x_0 \to 0$ as $kx_0 \to 0$, whilst valid for surface modes, is not valid for body modes. Instead, we must consider the scenario where $m_0x_0$ remains finite as $kx_0 \to 0$. This can occur only if $|m_0^2| \to \infty$ as $kx_0 \to 0$.  To ensure that $|m_0^2| \to \infty$, we are restricted to solutions that behave like $\omega^2 \to k^2c_\textrm{T0}^2$ as $kx_0 \to 0$. Considering Equation~\eqref{DR approx non-mag}, this can only be the case when $m_0^2 < 0$, \textit{i.e.} only for body modes. To find these solutions, set $\omega^2 = k^2c_\textrm{T0}^2(1 + \nu(kx_0)^2)$ for some $\nu > 0$ that is to be determined. To see why this form has been chosen, a substitution into the definition of $m_0^2$ demonstrates that $|m_0^2| \to \infty$ and $m_0x_0$ remains bounded as $kx_0 \to 0$, as required. Using this ansatz, Equation~\eqref{DR approx} has a countably infinite set of quasi-sausage body solutions which, in the thin slab limit, behave like
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = k^2c_\textrm{T0}^2\left[1 + \frac{c_\textrm{T0}^4(kx_0)^2}{c_0^2v_\textrm{A0}^2\pi^2j^2}\right], \quad \text{for} \quad j = 1, 2, \ldots. \label{thin slab saus body}
\end{equation}
There are also quasi-kink body solutions that, in the thin slab limit, behave like
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = k^2c_\textrm{T0}^2\left[1 + \frac{c_\textrm{T0}^4(kx_0)^2}{c_0^2v_\textrm{A0}^2\pi^2(j - \frac{1}{2})^2}\right], \quad \text{for} \quad j = 1, 2, \ldots. \label{thin slab kink body}
\end{equation}
Equations~\eqref{thin slab saus body} and \eqref{thin slab kink body} show us that to quadratic order in $kx_0$ the quasi-sausage and quasi-kink body modes do not depend on the external environment parameters. The effects of external density and temperature are felt in the higher order terms, which explains why Equations~\eqref{thin slab saus body} and~\eqref{thin slab saus body} are identical to the corresponding solutions in a thin symmetric slab derived by \citealt{rob81b}. This also explains theoretically why body modes only weakly depend on the asymmetry of the external plasma, as discussed in the context of magnetic field diagnostics in Section~\ref{sec: SMS}.


\subsubsection{Limiting case - wide slab} \label{sec: wide slab}

The wide slab approximation the limit of the slab width being is much larger than the wavelength, \textit{i.e.} when $kx_0 \gg 1$. To understand the properties of the eigenfrequencies in a wide asymmetric slab, it is instructive to return to the dispersion relation in lambda notation, Equation~\eqref{DR lambda}. For surface modes in the slab, the wide slab approximation implies that $m_0x_0 \gg 1$, therefore $\coth{m_0x_0} \approx 1$ (this is checked \textit{a posteriori} by \cite{rob81b}). Under this approximation, Equation~\eqref{DR lambda}, becomes
\begin{equation}
(\Lambda_0 + \Lambda_1)(\Lambda_0 + \Lambda_2) = 0,
\end{equation}
which gives us two families of solutions, one satisfying $\Lambda_0 + \Lambda_1 = 0$ and the other satisfying $\Lambda_0 + \Lambda_2 = 0$. These are equivalent to
\begin{equation}
	\rho_0m_j(\omega^2 - \omega_\textrm{A0}^2) + \rho_jm_0\omega^2 = 0,
\end{equation}
for $j = 1, 2$, respectively. This equation is the same as the dispersion relation governing surface waves along a single interface between a magnetized and a non-magnetized plasma, Equation\eqref{DR interface} for $v_{A1} = v_{A2} = 0$. Hence, the surface mode solutions of a wide asymmetric slab are precisely the those that propagate along each interface independently. This corroborates our intuition that, as the slab width increases, the interfaces have diminishing influence on each other. In the wide slab limit, the interfaces have no influence on each other at all, allowing each to oscillate independently with its own characteristic frequency.

Unfortunately, the body waves have no parallel in the single interface model because body waves in a slab owe their existence to both of the two interfaces. In the wide slab limit, body waves behave like $\omega^2 \to k^2c_0^2$ as $kx_0 \to \infty$. To see this, substitute the ansatz $\omega^2 = k^2c_0^2 \left(1 + \nu/(kx_0)^2\right)$ into the dispersion relation, Equation~\eqref{DR approx non-mag}, to retrieve the family of quasi-sausage body modes given by
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = k^2c_0^2\left[1 - \frac{\pi^2(j - \frac{1}{2})^2c_0^2}{(v_{A0}^2 - c_0^2)(kx_0)^2}\right], \quad j = 1, 2, \ldots \label{wide slab saus body}
\end{equation}
in the wide slab limit. Similarly, there exist quasi-kink body modes given by
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = k^2c_0^2\left[1 - \frac{\pi^2j^2c_0^2}{(v_{A0}^2 - c_0^2)(kx_0)^2}\right], \quad j = 1, 2, \ldots \label{wide slab kink body}
\end{equation}
in the wide slab limit. These solutions are valid only when $v_{A0} > c_0$.

This analysis may be repeated for $v_{A0} < c_0$ to find that, in the wide slab limit, there exist quasi-sausage body modes given by
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = k^2v_\textrm{A0}^2\left[1 - \frac{\pi^2(j - \frac{1}{2})^2v_{A0}^2}{(c_0^2 - v_{A0}^2)(kx_0)^2}\right], \quad \text{for} \quad j = 1, 2, \ldots \label{wide slab saus body2}
\end{equation}
and quasi-kink body modes of the form
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = k^2v_{A0}^2\left[1 - \frac{\pi^2j^2v_\textrm{A0}^2}{(c_0^2 - v_{A0}^2)(kx_0)^2}\right], \quad \text{for} \quad j = 1, 2, \ldots . \label{wide slab kink body2}
\end{equation}
These solutions demonstrate that, to quadratic order in $1/kx_0$, the wide slab body modes are independent of the external plasma parameters. Therefore, Equations~\eqref{wide slab saus body}-\eqref{wide slab kink body2} are identical to the body mode solutions in a wide symmetric slab \citep{rob81b}. Equations~\eqref{thin slab slow saus surf}-\eqref{thin slab kink body},~\eqref{wide slab saus body} and~\eqref{wide slab kink body} also appear in~\cite{li_etal13} for a symmetric magnetic slab with shear flow when the shear flow speed is set to zero.


\subsection{Numerical solutions} \label{sec: numerical solutions}

Numerical methods are required to investigate solutions to the asymmetric slab dispersion relation, Equation~\eqref{DR non-mag}, without having to rely on further approximations. Focus is placed on the additional physics that arises from the asymmetry of the external plasma.


\subsubsection{Description of numerical procedure}
To solve Equation~\eqref{DR non-mag} numerically, we view the left-hand-side as a function of the wave frequency, $\omega$, and wavenumber $k$. We call this function a \textit{dispersion function}. This means that for a given wavenumber value, we are solving a simple root-finding problem, where the aim is to find the zeros of the dispersion function. To accomplish this, we use the \textit{Secant method}. The Secant method is a standard root-finding procedure that is equivalent to the Newton-Raphson method utilising a finite difference approximation to the derivative of the dispersion function.


\subsubsection{Dispersion diagrams} \label{sec: disp diagrams}

	\caption{Dispersion diagram for the dispersion relation, Equation~\eqref{DR}. The surface (body) modes are in plotted red (blue) and the sausage (kink) modes are represented by solid (dashed) lines. The density ratios are $\rho_1/\rho_0 = 1.5$ and $\rho_2/\rho_0 = 2$, and the characteristic speed orderings are $c_2 = 1.2c_0$ and (a)$v_{A0} = 1.3c_0$ and (b)$v_{A0} = 0.9c_0$.}
	\label{fig: disp}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig: disp} illustrates the solutions to the dispersion relation, Equation~\eqref{DR non-mag}, for two orderings of the characteristic speeds. Figure~\ref{fig: disp sbs} illustrates the spectrum of modes we would expect to find in the corona and Figure~\ref{fig: disp sbb} illustrates the spectrum of modes we would expect to find in the photosphere.

In both coronal and photospheric conditions, there are slow sausage and kink surface modes (illustrated by the slowest red solution lines) and an infinite sequence of slow sausage and kink body modes (illustrated by the slowest blue solution lines). Each sausage body mode propagates faster than its corresponding kink mode, which agrees with the analytical solutions in Equations~\eqref{thin slab saus body},~\eqref{thin slab kink body},~\eqref{wide slab saus body}-\eqref{wide slab kink body2}.

In coronal conditions, there exist fast sausage and kink surface modes with phase speeds between $c_0$ and $\min{c_1, c_2}$. Figure~\ref{fig: disp sbs} shows that the minimum of $c_1$ and $c_2$ becomes a new cut-off, causing the fast kink surface mode to transfigure into a slow kink first-order body mode for smaller values of the slab width\footnote{More precisely, non-dimensionalised slab half-width.}, $kx_0$. In Section~\ref{sec: critical slab width}, the precise value of this critical slab width is determined and the eigenfunction is analysed across this transition.

In photospheric conditions, there exists and infinite sequence of fast sausage and kink body modes with phase speeds between $c_0$ and $\min{c_1, c_2}$. The


\subsubsection{Critical slab width for kink mode transfiguration} \label{sec: critical slab width}
First, let's derive an analytical expression for the critical slab width, over which the slow kink first-order body mode transitions into a fast kink surface mode. To do this, let $\omega^2 = k^2c_0^2(1 + \nu)$ for some $\nu \ll 1$. Then we have
\begin{equation}
m_0^2 = -\frac{\nu k^2c_0^2(v_A^2 - c_0^2(1 + \nu))}{(c_0^2 + v_A^2)(c_T^2 - c_0^2(1 + \nu))},
\end{equation}
which, when terms of quadratic and higher order in $\nu$ are neglected, reduces to
\begin{equation}
m_0^2 = \frac{\nu k^2(v_A^2 - c_0^2)}{c_0^2},
\end{equation}
and therefore,
\begin{equation}
\tanh(2m_0x_0) \approx 2kx_0\sqrt{\frac{\nu(v_A^2 - c_0^2)}{c_0^2}}.
\end{equation}
Substituting these into the dispersion relation for quasi-kink modes, neglecting terms of quadratic and higher order in $\nu$, and solving for $kx_0$ gives us the critical value for the 1st fast kink body mode as
\begin{equation}
kx_0 = \frac{c_0^2 \left(\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_0}c_2\sqrt{c_1^2 - c_0^2} + \frac{\rho_1}{\rho_0}c_1\sqrt{c_2^2 - c_0^2}\right)}{2(v_A^2 - c_0^2)\sqrt{(c_1^2 - c_0^2)(c_2^2 - c_0^2)}}.
\end{equation}

Across this transitional value, the eigenfunction changes functional form inside the slab from a trigonometric to a hyperbolic function (see Figure~\ref{fig: transitional kink eigenfunction}).

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Fast mode cut-off}
If $c_1 = c_2$, we have a symmetric slab and therefore no fast mode cut-off. Let $c_1 \neq c_2$ and let $\omega = \min(kc_1, kc_2)$. This makes either $m_1 = 0$ or $m_2 = 0$. Without loss of generality, consider the case where $\omega = kc_1$ and therefore $m_1 = 0$. This makes
\begin{equation}
m_0^2 = \frac{k^2 (c_0^2 - c_1^2)(v_A^2 - c_1^2)}{(c_0^2 + v_A^2)(c_T^2 - c_1^2)},
\quad \text{and} \quad
m_2^2 = k^2\left(1-\frac{c_1^2}{c_2^2}\right).
\end{equation}
Substituting these expressions in the dispersion relation gives us
\begin{equation}
\frac{c_1^2(c_0^2 - c_1^2)(v_A^2 - c_1^2)}{(c_0^2 + v_A^2)(c_T^2 - c_1^2)} - \sqrt{\frac{(c_0^2 - c_1^2)(v_A^2 - c_1^2)}{(c_0^2 + v_A^2)(c_T^2 - c_1^2)}}(v_A^2 - c_1^2)\frac{\rho_0}{\rho_1}\sqrt{1 - \frac{c_1^2}{c_2^2}}\coth(2m_0x_0) = 0.
\end{equation}
This equations can be solved for $kx_0$ to give the fast mode cut-off as
\begin{equation}
kx_0 = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{(c_0^2 - c_1^2)(v_A^2 - c_1^2)}{(c_0^2 + v_A^2)(c_T^2 - c_1^2)}}\tanh^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{B}\right),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
B = c_2c_1^2\frac{\rho_1}{\rho_0}\sqrt{\frac{(c_0^2 - c_1^2)}{(c_0^2 + v_A^2)(c_T^2 - c_1^2)(v_A^2 - c_1^2)(c_T^2 - c_1^2)}}.
\end{equation}

First, consider a magnetised slab with symmetric non-magnetic external plasma, as described by \cite{rob81b}. Figures~\ref{fig:densityratio}-\ref{fig:densityratio10} illustrate how varying the ratio of external to internal density affects the propagation speeds of the slow kink and sausage surface modes. An increase in the density ratio, $\rho_\textrm{e}/\rho_0$, causes a decrease in the propagation speed of the slow modes. The fast surface modes demonstrate an identical behaviour (not shown). The body modes are weakly dependent on the external density, so that the propagation speed decreases only negligibly as $\rho_\textrm{e}/\rho_0$ increases.

More generally, consider an asymmetric slab whose equilibrium conditions are given by Figure~\ref{fig:eq}. In Section~\ref{sec:symmetric comp} it was shown that the dispersion relation does not decouple into separate sausage and kink mode equations. However, their characteristics remain by and large, therefore the labels of ``quasi-sausage" and ``quasi-kink" may be used by referring to the anti-phase and in-phase oscillatory behaviour of the slab boundaries. However, we note that the quasi-kink mode now does not retain the width of the perturbed slab like the symmetric kink mode does.

Figures~\ref{fig:slow modes density}-\ref{fig:slow modes density3} illustrate the behaviour of the slow surface modes as the external density on one side of the slab is varied while holding fixed the other external density. The slice where $\rho_1/\rho_0=2$ corresponds to a symmetric slab, where the usual behaviour is observed: the phase speed of the two slow surface modes converges to a speed that is slower than the tube speed, $c_\textrm{T}$, as the slab width increases. However, as the external densities become distinct, the phase speeds of these modes become distinct for a wide slab. This can also be seen in Figures~\ref{fig:disp sbs} and~\ref{fig:disp sbb}.

For a wide slab width, $kx_0\gg1$, Figure~\ref{fig:slow modes density3} illustrates that the eigencurves of the slow surface modes demonstrate a wave phenomenon known as ``avoided crossing". Avoided crossings occur when the phase speeds of two wave modes avoid crossing when a parameter of the system is varied due to constraints preventing them from being equal; it demonstrates a transferral of properties between the two modes and can be used to give insight into the modal structure. There is rich literature regarding avoided crossings for the eigensolutions of a wide range of physical processes including energy level repulsion in quantum physics \citep{naq_etal72} and coupled spring oscillations in classical mechanics \citep{nov10}; in MHD the subject has been covered only briefly, for example between fast and slow magneto-acoustic gravity waves in a magnetically stratified plasma by \cite{abd90} and \cite{mat_etal2016}.

The characteristic speed orderings are $c_2=0.7c_0$, $v_\textrm{A}=0.4c_0$, and $c_1$ varies to satisfy equilibrium pressure balance, given by Equation~\eqref{sound and density}. The parameters at each blue and red dot in panel(a) are used to plot the spatial variation of the transverse displacement perturbation, $\widehat{\xi}_x$, given by panel (b). The upper (lower) plots in panel (b) correspond to the quasi-sausage (quasi-kink) mode solutions.}

\end{figure}

In the present study, the avoided crossing occurs between quasi-kink and quasi-sausage surface solutions to the asymmetric slab. This explains why the dispersion relation does not decouple into a sausage and a kink equation (Section~\ref{sec:symmetric comp}). Figures~\ref{fig:disp} and~\ref{fig:xi} demonstrate that during the transition across the avoided crossing, the quasi-sausage and quasi-kink modes exchange the slab boundary upon which the largest perturbation occurs. For example, the left plots of Figure~\ref{fig:xi} show that the quasi-sausage mode has its highest amplitude on the interface of highest local phase-speed (equivalently, lowest external density). The quasi-kink mode demonstrates the opposite behaviour. The central plots show the special case of a symmetric slab, where $\rho_1 = \rho_2$, demonstrating the spatial antisymmetry and symmetry in the symmetric sausage and kink mode, respectively. As the left external density, $\rho_1$, dominates the right external density, $\rho_2$, the right plots of Figure~\ref{fig:xi} show that again the quasi-sausage mode has its higher amplitude on the interface of higher local phase-speed, but this is now on the other interface. By the term local phase speed we are referring to the phase-speed of a slow surface mode travelling parallel to the magnetic field at an isolated density and magnetic interface between a magnetised and non-magnetised plasma, \textit{i.e.} half of the magnetic slab model. Each interface of an asymmetric magnetic slab has a distinct ''local" phase-speed, and according to \cite{rob81a}, these phase speeds are inversely proportional to the density in the non-magnetic region.

When they exist, the fast quasi-sausage and quasi-kink surface modes demonstrate an identical behaviour (not shown). As demonstrated analytically in Equations~\eqref{thin slab saus body}-\eqref{thin slab kink body} and \eqref{wide slab saus body}-\eqref{wide slab kink body2}, the body modes are not dependent on internal or external densities to leading order in $kx_0$. This means that body modes demonstrate only a weak dependence on the external densities, and an avoided crossing does not occur between these modes as the external densities are varied.


\subsubsection{Varying the degree of asymmetry}

\subsection{Analogy to coupled spring and mass oscillator}
\textcolor{red}{All this section needs editting. Also, maybe actually do the maths for this.}

To understand this further, we propose an analogy with a coupled mechanical simple harmonic oscillation system (more information can be found in \citealp{nov10}). Consider a system of two identical masses, between two fixed walls, with springs connecting the left wall to the left mass, the masses together, and the right mass to the right wall (Figure~\ref{fig:springs sym eq}). The three springs correspond to the three regions of plasma, and the masses to the interfaces. If the left and right springs have the same spring constant, then the two normal modes of oscillation are the oscillations where the masses are in phase (Figure~\ref{fig:springs sym inphase}) or in anti-phase (Figure~\ref{fig:springs sym inanti-phase}). These are analogous to the kink and sausage surface modes, respectively, in a symmetric magnetic slab. Consider now the case when the spring constants in the left and right springs are distinct (Figure~\ref{fig:springs asym eq}). In this case, the normal modes are asymmetric in-phase (Figure~\ref{fig:springs asym inphase}) and in-anti-phase oscillations (Figure~\ref{fig:springs asym inanti-phase}), analogous to the asymmetric quasi-kink and quasi-sausage magnetic slab modes, respectively. In this mechanical analogy, it is clear that for the in-phase mode, the higher amplitude will be on the side with smaller spring constant, and \textit{vice versa} for the in-anti-phase mode. A higher spring constant in the left or right springs in this analogy corresponds to a lower density outside the magnetic slab because a higher spring constant in an uncoupled spring gives a higher characteristic frequency. This gives us some motivation as to why the surface modes of the asymmetric magnetic slab have higher amplitudes on different sides for quasi-sausage and quasi-kink modes.

\textcolor{red}{This is analogous to the mechanical example introduced by \cite{all_etal17}. Consider two masses connected by a spring, with spring constant $k_0$, and each mass is also connected to a fixed wall on each side by springs with spring constants $k_1$ and $k_2$, respectively (see Figure~\ref{fig: wide slab mechanical analogy}). When the middle spring has a spring constant $k_0 \neq 0$, there are two modes, an in-phase mode (analogous to kink modes in a slab) and an in-anti-phase mode (analogous to sausage modes in a slab). When the two masses are decoupled by removing the middle spring, equivalently setting $k_0 = 0$, each mass oscillates independently at the natural frequency of that side of the spring-mass system. This decoupling provides a good analogy to the wide slab limit for the magnetic slab. Each interface can oscillate at its own natural frequency, independent of the other interface. Given that we are considering magnetoacoustic waves, there are two restoring forces, the magnetic tension force and the pressure gradient force, which means that each independent interface has two natural frequencies (depending on the parameters of the system, there can be 0, 1, or 2 frequencies), corresponding to the fast and slow magnetoacoustic modes. With this understanding of the modes in the wide slab limit, the amplitude ratio, $R_\textrm{A}$, is either $0$ or \textit{undefined}, depending on which interface the wave is propagating and is therefore not useful for magnetoseismology.}
